# INTEGRATION TESTS
##Challenges
- Balancing the robot on 3 wheels, with uneven weight, it keeps toppling over to one direction
- Upward facing ultrasonic

##Achieved
- Stop and pause
- Radar

##Notes
- The motors are driven using PWM signals as shown in the program
- A very simple PCB, if any, is needed
- The chasis is very promising
- Very fast motors
